# Vulnerability
HTML Injection

# Description
The vulnerability allows for HTML injection in a URL parameter, resulting in custom content being displayed when a user visits the crafted URL.

# Mitigation and remediations
A fix was deployed as part of Passbolt API v4.6.2. Error messages are now not used as part of the page title.
