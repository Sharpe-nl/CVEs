An issue was discovered in KramerAV VIA Connect (2) and VIA Go (2) devices with a version prior to 4.0.1.

### Vulnerability
Local/Remote code Execution (RCE) with root priviledges

### Description
When we have access to the device and can see the screen, we can use the default feature remote mouse to open certain settings that will launch a terminal. This escapes the kiosk mode and allows us to upgrade to root priviledges and get access to the entire system.

### Attack Scenario 
1. Connect to the device through usual way http://VIA_IP/viaIndex/index
2. View the current screen
3. Use the remote mouse option
4. Click on settings (exact place not disclosed yet)
5. An explorer window will open
6. Right click to open a terminal
7. Use ```sudo -l``` to find ways to get root access

### Mitigation
First update to version 4.0, then apply version 4.0.1.1326 or later.

**Note: The VIA Go/Connect version 1 and other devices like Connect PRO are EOL/EOS and will not have these security updates.**
